# StatesAndCapitals
The results of the tests are printed at the end of testStatesAndCapitals() with “System.out.println(testResults);”. “true” means a test is passing, while “false” means it is failing.  
In my code the Basic, Intermediate, Advanced 1, Advanced 2, and  Advanced 3 tests all be working.
